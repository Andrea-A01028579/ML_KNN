# ML_KNN
Implementation of a K Nearest Neighbors algorithm using python.


This repository contains two ipynb files, with the implementation code and a pdf document with the complete documentation of the code.

The Assesment2_clean notebook contains all implementation code (class definition, methods, library imports) and trail runs using toy data sets for both regression and classification. The toy dataset for classification is the iris dataset, imported from sklearn. The toy dataset for regression is the diabetes dataset, imported form sklearn. This code also includes the code implementation for the graph shown in the pdf report.

The Assesment2_clean_data contains the code for using the created KNN model in a non toy dataset. The non toy dataset is taken from Kaggle, and can be accessed through the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/higher-education-predictors-of-student-retention. 

The file AndreaBravo_24855773_A2_ML.pdf contains the documentation of the class, and is the report of the implementation.
